            I have a hobby of drawing since my childhood. I used to draw school homeworks very well but I left drawing when I was in 11th standard. One day when I was studying in SY I had an idea to draw a potrait of my friend. I drew it good enough but it wasnt looking so good I was unsatisfied with it. So I started making more artworks and after each one I could see my progress. Right now I am very good at making potrait sketche with pencils.<br/>
